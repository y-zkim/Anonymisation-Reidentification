# Anonymisation-Reidentification
Anonymisation-Reidentification is a competition where the aim is to anonymise a database and to reidentify the anonymized databases from other teams.

# About the project
From an original database, this project is about anonymising this database so it's not the object of a na√Øve reidentification (all data is in clear) and not loosing the utility (all changes must have a logic and should have a way back to original), but at the same time other databases which passed in the same process from other teams have to be reidentified, that means that the output of the reidentification code is a JSON file that contains guesses of id in each week.
